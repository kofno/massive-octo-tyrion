Massive Octo Tyrion
===================

I'm not much of a designer, but I wanted to make a site that would be mobile
friendly. To that I end, I opted to use a fluid layout on the frontend. I also
made sure to set Etags where appropriate, to avoid rendering and transferring
HTML whenever possible.

Similarly, I took advantage of the service's Etags to avoid transferring data
from the services.

Finally, from a maintenance stand point, I leveraged Rails wherever possible.
That left very little for me to actually code.

The Screenies

So, you've asked an engineer to build a web site. I bet you were expecting to
see Twitter Bootstrap. C'mon, you were. Well... you're right. But my
screenshots are from the iOS simulator.
